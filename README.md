# Research Data Inventory (RDI) User Interface
This project offers a flexible data inventory software that allow users to (1) aggregate experimental data from a federated database, (2) assign metadata which includes measurement settings, process parameters and process flow information, (3) visualize collected data, and (4) apply common analytic tools. To simplify the scope of the project, this software is only intended for graphical interaction with the data stored in servers, and not intended for excessive data wrangling, database management, or report automation. At this initial stage, it is expected that the user will have uploaded the cleaned data onto a federated server (to be explained in the later section) that is ready for analysis. To clean the data, the users can use python or commercial tools such as Excel. While slightly similar to JMP as an analytic tool, this software is less powerful (at the moment) but allow greater focus on the process pathways and process variabilities.
